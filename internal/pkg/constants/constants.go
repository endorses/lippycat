// Channel buffer sizes
//
// Buffer Sizing Strategy:
//
// 1. Single-item buffers (size = 1):
//    - Used for signals and errors that should never block the sender
//    - Examples: OS signals, error channels
//    - Rationale: These are infrequent events that must be handled immediately
//
// 2. Small buffers (size = 10):
//    - Used for control plane operations with low frequency
//    - Examples: Filter updates, batch queues
//    - Rationale: Control operations are rare but should not block; small buffer
//      provides cushion without excessive memory overhead
//
// 3. Medium buffers (size = 100):
//    - Used for moderate-throughput data plane operations
//    - Examples: Subscriber channels, general packet processing
//    - Rationale: Balance between latency and memory; suitable for operations
//      processing hundreds to low thousands of items per second
//
// 4. Large buffers (size = 1000):
//    - Used for high-throughput data plane operations
//    - Examples: PCAP writer queue, VoIP analyzer queues
//    - Rationale: High packet rates (10K+ pps) require larger buffers to absorb
//      bursts and prevent drops during GC pauses; memory cost justified by criticality
//
// Note: These are default sizes. Critical buffers can be made configurable via
// Config structs if deployment-specific tuning is needed.

	// Critical path for packet capture; large buffer prevents drops at high rates
