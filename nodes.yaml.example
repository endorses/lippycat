# lippycat Nodes Configuration (v0.2.4+)
# This file defines remote hunter and processor nodes for distributed capture

# Processor nodes (collect traffic from hunters)
processors:
  - name: main-processor
    address: processor.local:55555
    # Optional: Per-node TLS configuration (overrides global config)
    tls:
      enabled: true
      ca_file: /path/to/ca.crt
      cert_file: /path/to/client.crt
      key_file: /path/to/client.key
      skip_verify: false  # Set to true ONLY for testing (insecure!)
    # Optional: Subscribe to specific hunters only (empty = no hunters, omit = all hunters)
    # This can be changed interactively in TUI with 's' key
    subscribed_hunters:
      - edge-hunter-01
      - edge-hunter-02

  - name: backup-processor
    address: processor2.local:55555
    # No TLS configured - will use plaintext connection

  - name: secure-processor
    address: secure.example.com:55555
    tls:
      enabled: true
      ca_file: /etc/lippycat/certs/ca.crt
      cert_file: /etc/lippycat/certs/tui-client.crt
      key_file: /etc/lippycat/certs/tui-client.key
      skip_verify: false
    # Subscribe to all hunters (subscribed_hunters omitted)

# Hunter nodes (capture packets on network interfaces)
# Note: These are listed for reference but TUI connects to processors,
# not directly to hunters. Hunters are discovered via processor.
hunters:
  - name: edge-hunter-01
    address: 192.168.1.10:55555

  - name: edge-hunter-02
    address: 192.168.1.11:55555

  - name: datacenter-hunter
    address: dc-hunter.example.com:55555

# TLS Certificate Requirements:
# - Certificates MUST include Subject Alternative Name (SAN) matching hostname/IP
# - CN field is deprecated and no longer sufficient
# - See test/testcerts/generate_test_certs.sh for example certificate generation
#
# Hunter Subscription (v0.2.4+):
# - Press 's' on a processor in TUI to select hunters interactively
# - Press 'd' on a hunter to unsubscribe
# - Empty subscribed_hunters list = subscribe to no hunters
# - Omit subscribed_hunters field = subscribe to all hunters
#
# Usage:
# 1. Copy this file to ~/.config/lippycat/nodes.yaml or ./nodes.yaml
# 2. Update addresses and TLS paths for your environment
# 3. Run: lippycat tui --remote
# 4. Or specify custom path: lippycat tui --remote --nodes-file /path/to/nodes.yaml
#
# Interactive Management:
# - Press 's' to select hunters to subscribe to
# - Press 'd' to unsubscribe from hunter or remove processor
# - Use Settings tab to change nodes file path
