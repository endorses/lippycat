# Virtual Interface Implementation Plan

**Feature:** Virtual network interface for packet injection
**Purpose:** Enable third-party tools (Wireshark, Snort, Suricata, tcpdump) to monitor lippycat's packet stream
**Status:** Planning
**Target:** Core feature in `all`, `processor`, `cli` builds (opt-in via flag)

---

## Overview

This plan implements a virtual TAP interface that allows real-time packet injection for integration with standard network analysis tools. The feature transforms lippycat into a **universal packet broker** with filtering, protocol analysis, and tool integration capabilities.

**Scope:** Virtual interface support across multiple commands:
- **`lc sniff`** - Live capture + filtering → virtual interface
- **`lc sniff voip`** - VoIP-specific filtering + call tracking → virtual interface
- **`lc process`** - Distributed aggregation from hunters → virtual interface

**Key Use Cases:**
1. **PCAP Replay with Filtering** - `lc sniff voip -r huge.pcap --sipuser alice --virtual-interface` (like tcpreplay with filtering)
2. **Live Filtered Capture** - `lc sniff voip -i eth0 --virtual-interface` (expose VoIP-only stream to Wireshark/Snort)
3. **Distributed Aggregation** - `lc process --virtual-interface` (aggregate multiple hunters, expose unified stream)
4. **Protocol Enrichment** - lc's analyzers filter/enrich before exposing to standard tools

**Key Decisions:**
- **Reusable package** at `internal/pkg/vinterface/` (shared across commands)
- **Default interface name: `lc0`** (matches command name, short and clean, no conflicts)
- Linux-only initially (covers 90%+ server deployments)
- Use `github.com/vishvananda/netlink` (production-proven, used by Docker/Kubernetes)
- Opt-in activation via `--virtual-interface` flag (no mandatory root privileges)
- Equal status output channel alongside TUI, PCAP, and upstream forwarding

---

## Use Case Examples

### 1. PCAP Replay with Protocol Filtering (tcpreplay Alternative)
```bash
# Replay large PCAP, filtering for specific SIP user
sudo lc sniff voip -r 10GB-capture.pcap --sipuser alice --virtual-interface

# Monitor with Wireshark (only Alice's calls visible)
wireshark -i lc0

# Or run IDS on filtered stream
snort -i lc0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

**Benefit:** No need to pre-filter PCAP with tcpdump/editcap. lc filters in real-time during replay.

### 2. Live Capture with VoIP-Specific Filtering
```bash
# Capture only VoIP traffic, expose to virtual interface
sudo lc sniff voip -i eth0 --virtual-interface

# Multiple tools can monitor simultaneously
tcpdump -i lc0 -w voip-archive.pcap &
wireshark -i lc0 &
snort -i lc0 -c voip-rules.conf &
```

**Benefit:** VoIP-specific protocol detection and call tracking before injection. Tools receive clean, pre-filtered stream.

### 3. Distributed Capture Aggregation
```bash
# Processor aggregates from multiple hunters
lc process --listen 0.0.0.0:50051 --virtual-interface

# Single interface shows traffic from all edge sites
wireshark -i lc0  # See traffic from ALL hunters
```

**Benefit:** Centralized monitoring of geographically distributed capture points.

### 4. Format Conversion and Enrichment
```bash
# lc can reconstruct TCP streams, add metadata, filter protocols
sudo lc sniff -i eth0 --protocol voip,dns --virtual-interface

# Tools receive only specified protocols with lc's analysis
tshark -i lc0
```

**Benefit:** lc's protocol analyzers and reassembly engines work before tool integration.

  - [x] Sleep between injections to match original timing
  - [x] Only applies when --vif-replay-timing flag is set

#### Manual Testing
- [x] Test 1: Live VoIP capture with virtual interface
  - [x] `sudo lc sniff voip -i eth0 --virtual-interface`

- [x] Test 4: Custom interface name
  - [x] `sudo lc sniff voip -i eth0 --virtual-interface --vif-name lippycat-voip0`
  - [x] Verify custom name is used
- [x] Test 5: Packet timing replay (tcpreplay-like behavior)
  - [x] `sudo lc sniff voip -r test.pcap --virtual-interface --vif-replay-timing`
  - [x] Capture with `tcpdump -i lc0 -tttt -n`
  - [x] Verify packets arrive with realistic delays (not all at once)
  - [x] Compare timing with original PCAP
- [x] Test 6: Configurable startup delay
  - [x] `sudo lc sniff voip -r test.pcap --virtual-interface --vif-startup-delay 1s`
  - [x] Verify shorter startup delay allows faster testing
  - [x] `sudo lc sniff voip -r test.pcap --virtual-interface --vif-startup-delay 10s`

## Implementation Notes

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Reusable Package**: `internal/pkg/vinterface/` is shared across all commands (not command-specific)
2. **Opt-in Design**: Virtual interface is disabled by default, activated via `--virtual-interface` flag
3. **Default Name**: `lc0` for all commands (short, matches command name, no conflicts)
4. **Equal Output**: Virtual interface is one of multiple output channels (TUI, PCAP, upstream)
5. **Non-blocking**: Virtual interface never blocks packet stream (drops on overflow)
6. **Platform-specific**: Linux-first approach with documented workarounds for other platforms
7. **Graceful Degradation**: Command continues without virtual interface on failure

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Injection rate | 100k pps | Counter: packets_injected/second |
| Latency (p50) | < 1 ms | Hunter receive → TAP write timestamp |
| Latency (p99) | < 10 ms | Tail latency measurement |
| CPU overhead | < 10% | CPU profiling during injection |
| Memory overhead | < 50 MB | RSS increase with virtual interface enabled |
| Drop rate | < 0.1% | Under normal load (< 100k pps) |

### Dependencies

```bash
# Add to go.mod
go get github.com/vishvananda/netlink
```

### Security Considerations

- **Privilege Requirement**: Creating TAP/TUN devices requires `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability
- **Mitigation**: Use file capabilities instead of running as root
  ```bash
  sudo setcap cap_net_admin+ep /usr/local/bin/lc
  ```
- **Phase 3**: Implement privilege dropping after interface creation
- **Phase 3**: Network namespace isolation for additional security

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Packet conversion, error handling, configuration validation
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end hunter → processor → TAP → tcpdump
3. **Performance Tests**: Throughput, latency, CPU/memory overhead
4. **Tool Compatibility Tests**: tcpdump, Wireshark, Snort, Suricata
5. **Chaos Tests** (Phase 3): Interface deletion, permission revocation, high load

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- Reusable vinterface package created
- TAP interface works with `lc sniff voip`
- Packets visible in tcpdump/Wireshark
- PCAP replay filtering works (`-r` mode)
- Zero crashes during testing

### Phase 2 (Production)
- Virtual interface works in all three commands (sniff, sniff voip, process)
- Works with tcpdump, Wireshark, Snort
- All tests passing (unit + integration)
- Documentation complete for all commands
- Performance targets met

### Phase 3 (Advanced)
- Network namespace isolation working
- Cross-platform documented
- Advanced features functional (filtering, rate limiting, multi-interface)

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Permission errors (CAP_NET_ADMIN) | High | Clear error messages, documentation on setcap |
| Packet conversion bugs | High | Comprehensive unit tests, validation with Wireshark |
| Performance overhead | Medium | Benchmarking, optimization, async processing |
| Platform compatibility | Low | Linux-first approach, document workarounds |
| Interface cleanup on crash | Medium | Defer cleanup, shutdown hooks, integration tests |

---

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Create GitHub issue/epic for virtual interface feature
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation:
   - Start with reusable `internal/pkg/vinterface/` package
   - Initial integration with `lc sniff voip` (simplest use case)
   - Validate PCAP replay filtering workflow
4. Iterate based on testing and feedback
5. Expand to other commands in Phase 2

## Value Proposition

This feature positions lippycat as a **universal packet broker** that:
- **Captures** packets (live or from PCAP files)
- **Filters** by protocol, user, call ID, etc.
- **Analyzes** with protocol-specific detectors
- **Exposes** clean streams to industry-standard tools

The virtual interface is the bridge that makes lippycat interoperable with the entire ecosystem of network security and analysis tools - without requiring custom plugins or adapters for each tool.
